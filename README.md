## ⚒️ 3D Asset Creation (Blender)

Our evily friend was modeled, sculped and painted entirely in [Blender](https://blender.org/).

- Base mesh made using sculpting
- Painted using blender paint tool 
- Sculpted entirely using different blender tools and helpers

> 💡 Blender lights and cameras were used for layout reference, but overridden in Three.js for dynamic lighting and shadows

Final render from blender :

## 🔮 Future ideas

- More mastermind variants for example more other wordly, eldritch assets
- Animating facials and enhancment quality of different part of face
- Following the cursor and act some expressions based on user action
- Reducing triangles to improve sculpt performance
